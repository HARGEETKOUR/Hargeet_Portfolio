## Projects<br>
### Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study<br>
The Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study is an analytical project that investigates the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members of a bike-share program in Chicago. Utilizing data from Divvy, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover differences in riding habits, preferences, and potential strategies to convert casual users into loyal members. The project involved data cleaning, visualization in Tableau, and actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies for the company.<br>

### Classic Models Sales Overview 2004<br>
The Sales Overview Dashboard project leverages the Classic Models database to provide a detailed analysis of sales performance across various product lines and geographical locations. Using SQL to create structured tables and Power BI for visualization, I developed interactive dashboards that highlight key metrics, such as net profit and sales trends. The dashboard features slicers for temporal analysis and includes decomposition trees to dissect sales data by product line and country, enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth.<br>
